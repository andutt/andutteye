# THINGS TO DO ON AEMANAGEMENT REPOSITORY SIDE.
#
# 1: Popuplate a rpm package repository under packages/<distributionname>/0. Put all package on your distributions cd:s
#    or other media there.
#
# 2: Execute bin/aemanagement-api.pl -genrpmindex=/var/jail/aemanagement/packages<distributionname>/0 to generate
#    the andutteyemanagement register file. Set correct linux permissions chown aemanagement:aemanagement *, chmod 440 *
#    to the files under the 0 directory.
#
# 3: Create a hostspecification named after the host that shall connect to the repository. Set the distribution
#    that you just populated: distribution:<distributionname>. Change the other parameters after your needs.
#
# 4: Create a ~aemanagement/.ssh directory and create a authorized_keys2 file. Make sure that the direcotyr .ssh have 
#    permissions 700 and the authirozed_keys2 file has 600 also make sure that the .ssh directory and file are
#    owned by aemanagement, otherwhise ssh vill complain. Paste in the publickey that your connected agents shall
#    use and then before the key paste in this line.
# 
#   no-pty,no-X11-forwarding,no-port-forwarding,command="bin/aemanagement-sshwrapper.pl"
#
#   This will force every incoming request to be parsed by the ssh-wrapper program. 
# 
#   Also create a filed called environment under the .ssh directory with your path to the andutteye management
#   reposptiry in it. Like this:ANDUTTEYEMANAGEMENT_REPOSITORY=/var/jail/aemanagement this is used by the wrapper
#   to include its parameters.
#
# 5: Make sure that the ssh option:PermitUserEnvironment is set to yes in your /etc/ssh/sshd_config to permit the 
#    enviroment file. Restart sshd if you change it now.
#
# 6: If you want to change the location on the andutteyemanagement repository, just move the directory aemanagement/*
#    and change ANDUTTEYEMANAGEMENT_REPOSITORY parameter in ~aemanamagement/.ssh/environments and in 
#    /etc/profile.d/aemanagement.pl and in  config/aemanagement-config.conf
#
# 7: Review the config/aemanagement-config.conf and change your mail parameter and enable or disable andutteye surveillance
#    reporting. If enabled all andutteyemanagement anomolies will be reported to andutteye surveillance.
#
# 8: Popuplate your files/ directory with the direct paths and files that you want to administrate centraly. The best
#    match of files will be used. First DEFAULT tagged files and the best match is the file tagged with the hostname. 
#    For example:/etc/nsswitch.conf--DEFAULT will be the first match for all aemanagement agents and /etc/nsswitch--andutteye
#    will be the best match for hostname andutteye. Matching is done in order:DEFAULT, GROUP, WHERE, GROUP-WHERE, GROUP-PATCHLEVEL
#    WHERE-PATCHLEVEL, GROUP-WHERE-PATCHLEVEL, HOSTNAME, HOSTNAME-PATCHLEVEL.

#    create a ssh key pair as root like, ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 3048 -f aemanagement. Set a blank password.
#
# 3: Review the parameters in the top of /opt/aemanagement/aemanagement.pl that they match that you have done.
#
