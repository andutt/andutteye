#    This file specifies which Andutteye modules that shall be enabled for this
#    system. The Andutteye init program parses this configuration file to be 
#    able to know which modules to start. Note! The modules will be started in 
#    the order specified here, so the first to be started should be andutteyedsrv
#    to be able to serve other components requests.
